# Game Rules
The playing field is divided into cells, some of which are mined. To win, you need to open all the cells without hitting the mines. The open cells display numbers, each number is the number of mines in the adjacent cells. Using this information, you can determine which cells contain mines. The suspected cell with a mine can be marked with a flag using the **right mouse button** or **CTRL**+**Space** or **CTRL**+**Enter**.

To start a new game, you need to click on the **happy smiley** (or the **Space**/**Enter** on the keyboard). The remaining number of mines is displayed in the left corner, and the game timer is in the right corner.
